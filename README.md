# PythonBeginnersWorkbook
Python Beginners Workbook for Secondary Schools is an open-source workbook that teachers can use alongside their teaching.


## Work in progress
OK currently, I am updating an older workbook i produced a while back that just needed the revamp. Making the whole thing open source makes sense to me since I believe information should be free to an extent.

## The idea behind it all
* A workbook thats teachers can print out and give to students.
* Pages should be A4 in size
* Tasks should allow students to practice in order to gain confidence through familiarity of concepts.
* more to come

## For contributers...
Trying to get the layout to work in markdown has been a lot of trial and error. Thanks to [this post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/60502719/3550161) I have been able to embed codeblocks into tables for side by side code and text or images.
