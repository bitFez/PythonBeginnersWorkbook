# Introduction

This book aims to be used as a workbook to introduce students to programming in the Python programming language in a simple manner.
We can often find that younger learners can often find concepts hard to grasp without enough example and practice to develop confidence. Programming should be accessible to all learners.

The aim of the book is to avoid teaching any concepts too complicated for the time being and teach young learners in the same way they may learn other concepts in a secondary school using exemplary and repetitive exercises. 
Itâ€™s important to note that this book is not meant to replace the teaching of concepts in the classroom but to help reinforce some of the topics with worksheets that students can use to practice the concepts that have been discussed by a teacher. You will find on many of the worksheets that to avoid having too much text, I have left out some explanations that may involve giving the student too much information and detract from practicing the new skill.

In essence, computer programming is all about solving problems. The aim of this book is to help teach the basic syntax and concepts of Python before presenting students with more complicated problem solving tasks later on (probably to be presented in book 2).
