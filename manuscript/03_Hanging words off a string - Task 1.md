# Hanging words off a string - Task 1
In Python, getting the computer to write words can be done using the print function.
For example the code would look like this:
~~~
`print("Hello World")`
~~~
The word *print* tells Python that you want it to *print* or display some words on the screen.
This is called printing a string. Imagine letters being stringed up back to back and displayed on the screen in the order they have been strung up!

In between the brackets we also need to add what we want Python to print in quotation marks.
So I could write:
"My name is He-Man"
Like this:
        `print("My name is He-Man")`
 
Did you notice how the print function is written in lowercase?
Write your name in the box below using the Python language.

Write another line in the Python language stating who your favourite singer
 or band is.

What do you think would happen if the Python code you wrote included quotation marks?
For example:

`print("She said "she loves you" and you know you should be glad")`

Try this out in Python and write your answer in the box below.
