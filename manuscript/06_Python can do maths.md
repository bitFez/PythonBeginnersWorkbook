# Python can do maths!
Python can be used to work out maths problems. You can test this out just by typing equations into Python and seeing for yourself.

Try the following:
2 * 2
2 + 2
2 / 2
2 - 2

The +, - / and * symbols are called operators because they tell the computer to do an operation. try the following in the Python interpreter and write the answers next to the equations. 

12 * 12

1 + 78

45 / 3 

10 * 10

10 / 2

10 + 10

10 â€“ 2

10 + 10 + 10

10 * 2 + 5 / 2 - 2

In Python an integer is a whole number such as 5, 10, 123 or 7. 
A floating point number is a number with decimals such as 1.1, 0.5 or 2.99.
A number with a decimal point of 0 such as 2.0 is still considered as a whole number so is an integer.

Use the Python interpreter to work out these equations:

2 + 5.6
2 * 5.6
12 / 1.2
7.8 - 4
15 / (1.5 * 3)
