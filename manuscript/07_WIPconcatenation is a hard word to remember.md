# Concatenation is a hard word to remember!
So you have now seen that Python can be used to work out equations, we will now ask Python to print (*display*) numbers and words together. In programming languages joining together strings with numbers or strings with more strings is called concatenation. When there is a mixture of more than one type of data, Python can struggle with this! for example integers with strings or strings with floats (numbers with decimals).

For example I could write:

`print( "2+2 = " + str(2+2) )`

## Casting
when there is a mixture of more than one data type, we can use casting to convert from one type of data to another. This works well with integers or floats.


Try the following concatenations in the Python interpreter and correct the incorrect code by writing the answer in the box below.

1 - print("hello " + "world)

~~~


~~~

2 - print("I am Jerry, and I am " + 14  years old")

~~~


~~~

3- print(‘I’m Jerry and I’m’ + 14 + ‘years old’)

~~~


~~~

4- print("if I had 1 apple and 2 pears, I would have " + str(2 + 1) fruit)

~~~


~~~

5- print("if I had ", 1, "apple and ", 2 "pears, I would have ", 2 + 1, "fruit")

~~~

The code above demonstrates that a comma can be used similar to a +. This doesn’t actually concatenate but simply also passes something else into the print function. We will do more of this in book 2.
