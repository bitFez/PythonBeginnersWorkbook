# Variables Task 1
Assigning a variable is easy in Python. Whenever any word or number follows a `=` symbol, it is considered by Python to be a variable.
For example to set a variable called *bandName* to The Beatles we would do this:

`bandName = "The Beatles"`

Now we can concatenate the variable with a string.

```python
bandName = "The Beatles"
print("The most successful band ever were " + bandName)
```

Try these out and see if you can correct the errors:

<!-- Would be good if I could include a number in front of each task. This seems to upset the code block layout -->
```python
bandName = "The beatles"
print(bandName  " had 27 number 1 singles")
```

```python
bandName = "The beatles"
print("bandName", are the most successful band ever with 15 number 1 albums)
```

Complete the following code:
``` 
bandName = "The beatles"
nickName = "The Fab Four"
print(bandName + "were also known as _____________________________________________________________________)
```
---
We can change variables by reassigning the variable as something else. for example:
```
batman = "Adam West"
batman = "Michael Keaton"
batman = "George Clooney"
```

Every time the variable `batman` is reassigned as something else it overwrites the old data contained.
Use the Python interpreter to :
1. Assign Christian Bale to the variable `batman`
2. Print the variable `batman`
3. Assign Ben Affleck & print the `batman` variable
4. Assign Pattenson as the new batman and display this by printing the variable out again.
