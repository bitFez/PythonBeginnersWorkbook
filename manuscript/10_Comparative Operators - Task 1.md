# Comparative Operators - Task 1
In programming we often ask computers to make checks to see if something is true or false.
This helps computers make decisions based on the algorithms we write. Take for example our game hero, Mahmoud. If his lives reduce to 0 then the game would finish and display the
game over screen:
```python
lives = 1
if lives == 0:
    print(“Game Over!!”)
```
You would have learned about comparative operators in maths lessons. Try these out in the Python Interpreter and write the answers down. Python will reply either True or False:

1.    3 < 1
~~~


~~~

2.    3 > 1
~~~


~~~

3.    3 == 2+1 [1^]
~~~


~~~

4.    5 -2 > 1
~~~


~~~

5.   1 == 1
~~~


~~~

6.   0 > 0.001
~~~


~~~
[1^]: In Python remember that using the `=` symbol creates/assigns a variable. In order to test whether something is equal to something we use `==`.
