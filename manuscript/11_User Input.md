# User Input
We have looked at how to write text and how to create variables but now we need to get the computer to ask questions and save the answer we give.

Python uses the input() function to ask a question to the program’s user. 
For example:

| | |
|-|-|
|`input("What is your name?: ")` | The first line asks for your name.|
|`print("my name is R2D2")` | The 2nd line merely states a name.|

The problem with the above code is that after asking for your name, the program doesn’t save it. Do you remember that by using a `=` symbol we assign a variable?
```python
yourName = input("What is your name?:   ")
print("my name is R2D2")
print(yourName + " was my dad's name")
```
Now the computer remembers the name you give and can use it.

1. Get Python to ask for your name. Python must reply to you and say hello to ***you*** while referring to *you* using your name. Write the code into box below.

2. Now get Python to ask you for your name and age. Python must reply hello, *[your name]* and tell you that you are the same age. Write the code into box below.
