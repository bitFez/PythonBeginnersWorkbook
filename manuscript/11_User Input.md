# User Input
We have looked at how to write text and how to create variables but now we need to get the computer to ask questions and save the answer we give.

Python uses the input() function to ask a question to the programmeâ€™s user. 
For example:
| Syntax | Description |
| :----------- | :----------- |
| ```python
input("What is your name?:   ")
print("my name is R2D2")``` | Title |
| Paragraph | Text |
