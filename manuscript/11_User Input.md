# User Input
We have looked at how to write text and how to create variables but now we need to get the computer to ask questions and save the answer we give.

Python uses the input() function to ask a question to the programmeâ€™s user. 
For example:
:----------- | :----------- 
`input("What is your name?: ") print("my name is R2D2")` | The first line asks for your name.
 Paragraph | Text 


| | |
|-|-|
|`NOTE` | This is something I want you to notice. It has a lot of text, and I want that text to wrap within a cell to the right of the `NOTE`, instead of under it.|

|`input("What is your name?: ")` | The first line asks for your name.|
|-|-|
|`print("my name is R2D2")` | The 2nd line merely states a name.|
|-|-|

| | |
|-|-|
|`NOTE` | This is something I want you to notice. It has a lot of text, and I want that text to wrap within a cell to the right of the `NOTE`, instead of under it.|
