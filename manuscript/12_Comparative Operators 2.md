# Comparative Operators 2 - If Statements
Your task now is to combine a comparative operator with an input. Computers often use if statements to determine what decision to make. We touched on this earlier with Mahmut who lost a life when he touched a coin.

<table>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-0lax" colspan="2">Task 1. Let’s write a basic if statement using a variable first.</td>
  </tr>
<tr>
<td> 

```python
age = int(input("What is your age?"))
if age < 16:
    print("you are young!")
else:
    print("your are getting old!")
```

</td>

Re-write this if statement to ask how many marbles I have. (Notice how the code int is infront of input because the data being entered is a number.)

If the person has less than 6 marbles, it should reply “I have more than you”
If the answer is else, it should reply, “Wow that’s a big collection of marbles!!”

</td>
</tr>

Write your answer below

Task 2. New challenge. Let’s get Python to ask if my name is John. If it is, Python should reply, “That’s my name too!” if else Python should reply, “Well it’s not a great name but it will do”.
```





```
Remember the == operator checked if something was the same as something else.
