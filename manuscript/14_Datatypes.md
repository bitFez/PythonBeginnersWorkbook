# Datatypes
Programming involves asking a computer to work with different types of data. For example numbers and words. We will mainly focus on 3 types.
Python understands that numbers are different than strings. For example it can work out an equation with numbers like `2 * 2` but not with strings like `apple * bananas`. There are exceptions to this and you will see.

## Task 1
Use the Python command prompt and type in the following to tell us what type of data type each of these are:

```python
print(type(10))



```

```python
print(type(10.5))



```

```python
print(type('letters & words'))



```

## Task 2
Try to do the same with these using the Python command prompt too:
`34`, `"phone"`, `99.9`, `"The Hobbit"`, `"12"`, `'16'`, `0.9`, and `12.45`. Don't worry about writing the answers down for these.

## Task 3
Do you understand the 3 different data types? Try to explain what the difference between an integer, a float and a string is.

Your teacher will discuss the answers with you.
