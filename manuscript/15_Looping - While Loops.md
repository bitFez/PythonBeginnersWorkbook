Computers can be programmed to continue repeating code ***while*** a condition has not been met.

```python
stop = int(input("What stop are we at?"))
while age != "Waterloo":
    print("This isn't our stop.")
    stop = int(input("What stop are we at?"))
```

As you can see in the example on the left, the code will keeping iterating and asking the same question ***while*** the answer is not *Batman*.

Notice the nesting of statements underneath the while? It is the indented code that will keep looping.
