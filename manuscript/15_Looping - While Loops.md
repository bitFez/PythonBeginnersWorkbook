# Looping - While Loops
Computers can be programmed to continue repeating code ***while*** a condition has not been met.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td> 

```python
age = int(input("What's your age?"))
while age <12:
    print("You are too young to watch 12 rated movies.")
    
```

</td>
<td>

As you can see in the example on the left, the code will keeping iterating and asking the same question ***while*** the answer is not *Batman*.

Notice the nesting of statements underneath the while? It is the indented code that will keep looping.

</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
