# Variables task 3 - Using Variables for Calculations

By now we know that variables can represent both numbers and text. We shall try to use variables to store formula to make it easy to calculate equations.
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
Area of a square is **height x length**

```python
area = x * y
```

</td>
<td>

```python
height = int(input("What the height of your rectangle in CM?")) 
length = int(input("What the length of your rectangle in CM?"))
area = height * length
print("the area of the rectangle is " + str(area) + "cm\xb2")

#Note that the code: \xb2 is an escape code which we will cover later.

```

</td>
</row>
</tbody>
</table>

Task 1 - Use the example above to write a Python script to work out the area of a triangle asking the user for the height and width. The area of a triangle is base x height รท 2 (`area=x*y/2`).
```






```

Now use the example above to write a Python script to work out the area of a circle by asking the user for the radius. This is quite a hard task but you should be able to work it out if you could work it out on a calculator. The first variable has been written for you :smile:

```python
pi = 3.14








```
