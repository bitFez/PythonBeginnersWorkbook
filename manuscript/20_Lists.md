# Lists
A list in Python is a container that holds a list of data (this can be either strings or integers). For example below is a shopping list for things that need to be bought.

```python
shopping = ['bread', 'cola', 'shampoo', 'donuts', 'cheese']
```
To create a list give it a name (the same way you did for a variable) and put items of the list in square brackets separated by commas. 

Task 1
Create a list called avengers for The Avengers characters, Captain America, Thor, The Hulk and Iron Man.
```python



```

Try to print the list in Python by typing 
```python
print(avengers)
```

In programming languages indexing usually starts from 0. Therefore the first item in the list is 0 and the second item is 1.
We can print out individual items from a list by typing the list name followed by the item number in square brackets.

```python
print(shopping[0])
```

Task 2
a. Write the code to print the third string in the avengers list.
```



```

b. Write the code to concatenate: “The character who has a special hammer is “ with the 2nd string in the list.
```



```

c. Write the code to concatenate that your favourite characters are the 1st and 4th in the list.
```
