# Hanging words off a string - Task 1
In Python, getting the computer to write words can be done using the print function.
For example the code would look like this:
~~~
`print("Hello World")`
~~~
The word *print* tells Python that you want it to *print* or display some words on the screen.
This is called printing a string. Imagine letters being stringed up back to back and displayed on the screen in the order they have been strung up!

In between the brackets we also need to add what we want Python to print in quotation marks.
So I could write:
"My name is He-Man"
Like this:
        `print("My name is He-Man")`
 
Did you notice how the print function is written in lowercase?
Write your name in the box below using the Python language.
